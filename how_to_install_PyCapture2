How to install the correct version of PyCapture2

Pre-requisites: A virtual environment must already have been created. See "how_to_create_a_virtual_environment" for information on that step.

1. Locate the PyCapture2 directory in the git repo or download a version of PyCapture from PTGrey's website (it will be followed by a version number; e.g. PyCapture2-2.13.31)

2. Ensure the the version of PyCapture you have downloaded matches the version of FlyCapture2 that you have.

3. If FlyCapture2 is not yet installed, follow instructions provided by PTGrey for how to install it onto your system

4. Using the bash terminal, navigate to your PyCatpture2 directory and see that you have the "setup.py" file

5. Run the setup.py file USING THE VERSION OF PYTHON IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

	5a. From bash, run the following command (with your actual path):
		[your path]/python3 setup.py install

	5b. Your path will probably look like this if you setup your virtual environment in accordance with the other tutorial:
		~/.virtualenvs/[name of your virtual environment]/bin
	
	5c. Make sure that you have installed PyCapture into the virtual environment by navigating to the site-packages for the virtual environment and seeing that it is there (This will be in ~/.virtualenvs/[name of your virtual environment]/lib/python3.6/site-packages/

	5d. PyCapture2 will most likely show up as version 0.0.0, and I'm not sure why. As long as you use the correct setup.py file, it will work.
